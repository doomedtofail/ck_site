### Where I'm from

Born and raised near the UK's second city of Birmingham. 

Growing up, I always knew I wanted to be within an engineering discipline, but never quite knew what options were available or what those disciplines looked like. 

An apprenticeship in Mechanical Maintenance quickly set me on the path of Electronic Engineering, and I never looked back.

### What I do now

Currently, I work with [Energym](index.md), a smart-tech fitness company, developing gym equipment that turns your workout into usable electrical power. âš¡ðŸš´

Looking after a range of teams including: Electronic Design, Embedded Firmware, MobileDev, WebDev.

Helping scale the business through the startup phase in a range of tech stacks and disciplines. 

### What I used to do

My apprenticeship in the defence industry kickstarted my career, a great insight into high-security, high-reliability, 40+ Year design life products with immense documentation and rigorous certification and compliance process. 

After a few years I migrated into the Consumer Electronics world, working with some incredibly talented colleagues at [Vax](https://www.vax.co.uk/), [TTI](https://www.ttigroup.com/), [Gtech](https://www.gtech.co.uk/).
This period got me excited about the Consumer Electronics industry and set me on the path to stay within it.

I've also been part of a [privately funded Start-up accelerator](https://beta-den.com/), this process was a doorway to taking my knowledge from being primarily technical focused, to also being commercially focused and aware.

My roles have allowed me to travel and stay in manufacturing regions in the Far East, working with overseas factories and building some incredible relationships with overseas colleagues.

### What I hope to achieve

My somewhat unique background within the Electronics/Electronic Systems space has given me the opportunity to gain a "cradle to grave" insight into the process.

I am always looking to leverage this insight by working with projects or people who are looking to excel in:
- Electronic Design, Testing, and Manufacturing
- Overseas Manufacturing and Testing
- IoT Systems and Low Power Devices
- Consumer Electronics 
- BLE, Wi-Fi, CANBus, J1939, LoRa, 5G
- Full product lifecycle design process (yes, literally all of it)
- Cost efficient design and development
